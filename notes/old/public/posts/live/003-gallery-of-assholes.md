# La Galerie Of Fucking Assholes

**First and foremost I had to do research on the Solana network to write this so a giant fuck you to all of you stupid fucking sluts for forcing me to know a little more of how that steaming hot pile of garbage works so that I can properly insult you about it.**

You can check out this stupid fucking thing here:

https://www.lagaleriedesnft.com

Honestly, what the fuck is wrong with you people? You honestly believe a project that encapsulates the absolute worst of the industry is your big break in crypto? What the fuck are any of you thinking signing up for this project? Do your agents know what you're fucking getting up to? Did they recommend you for this pile of hot garbage? Fuuuuck. Use your fucking brain. Do any of you know shit about shit? Obviously not.

What the fuck do you think is going to come from this? This thing that you probably barely even fucking understand. Huh? Well? Can you at least fucking read well maybe? Did you at least read their fucking website?

They literally trip themselves up in the first fucking paragraph! "'La Galerie des Nft' is a digital art gallery with collections from artists all over the world. We are the bridge between the community and the artists. We’re only having collections that we consider valuable for our holders."

So it's a fucking gallery of assholes advertised for assholes by assholes. What, you think you're being cute hiding behind the facade of porn to make some money while ripping people off? Get the fuck out of here.

1) it is NOT a gallery with collections from artists all over the world
2) it is NOT a bridge between the community and artists. What fucking artists? The ones painting photographs of  assholes? You are not an artist just because you had your fucking ass photographed and you know it.
3) it is NOT having any valuable collections for holders- it's literally a ponzie scheme with extra steps

Some more of their bullshit claims:
> "All the 2000 Muses that inspired their NFTs will receive a % of the sales and resales of their own NFT for life.""

HOW THE FUCK ARE THERE 2000 MORONS THAT SAID YES TO THIS

> "Anal sex is great when its consensual that’s why our protocol is not ETH but solana."

What an absolutely fucking pathetic attempt at being punny.

> "7,5% of all the collections will be given to struggling artists around the world"

HOW???? HONESTLY FUCKING HOW??

> "For the first time in NFTS history, the community will decide which are the rarest NFTs (by vote)"

False but also HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU VOTING??? Where is this explained? Where is this codified in a way that cannot be manipulated? That can be verified? That's right- you guess it. Nowhere. Fucking hell why don't you dipshits just vote to send me all your money instead at least I'm honest about how I'm gonna fuck you.

> "There are millions of artists around the world who cannot pay their bills because they believe in their art. We want to show appreciation and a sincere “thank you” to those who are struggling to provide us with a more beautiful world to live in. Therefore, 7,5% of the sale will be distributed among the resilient artists all around the world (videos will be on YouTube)."

WHAT THE FUCK WILL VIDEOS DO FOR STRUGGLING ARTISTS?? How the fuck are you going to decide who's a struggling artist? How the fuck are you going to pay them? WHERE are the proceeds coming from? How often? FUCK people THINK. What do fucking youtube videos even have to do with anything? There is absolutely nothing here but fucking hopium and bullshit.

------------------------------------------

Do any of you have any idea how many fucking scams exist in crypto? I'll give you a hint. It's a lot. 99% of crypto related projects can easily be refuted to be scams or ripoffs. It's not fucking rocket science- they literally fucking tell you if you pay attention. Everything they have printed on their website is a flat out lie dressed up in fancy fucking fonts. None of you likely have any idea how crypto or blockchain technology works this so some buzzwords is all it takes to have you unknowledgeable dipshits throwing your money (and public image) into the wind like the farts outta your asses.

Take a fucking moment and **think**. Do you know what an NFT is? If you think an NFT is "a jpeg or funny image" not only are you flat out wrong but you are completely fucking retarded for having connected yourself in any way shape or form to a project at all without knowning anything about what they make. Where is the smart contract for these NFTs, hmm? Where is the thing that says verbatim written in stone what these NFTs are and how all of you are getting paid? Hmmmmmmm? Do you even fucking know where that is? Their site doesn't even fucking provide a link to their own gallery! Do you even know what NFTs on Solana are? They have NONE of the security and technological advantages that comes with Ethereum. NONE. It was practically literally made to make NFT scamming cheaper and easier. FUUUUUUCK. Why are you all fucking around on the dumb kids playground? Are you all that fucking desperate for cash or can none of you really fucking read?

It's alright, I found it. Their collection can be found here:

https://solsea.io/collection/6228e86ecb4ab77875a57c56

Not that it'll do much good for the lot of you fucking empty headed morons.

There are currently 31 of the supposed 2000 "rare" assholes. Each token is represented by a "hidden" painting. Each states: "This is a Top Secret Anus from 'Le Bel Anus' NFT Collection, wait for the reveal to see which nft you will have the pleasure to own." Creator royalties on secondary sales are 10%. EACH TRADE THE CREATORS (not you, morons) RECEIVE 10 fucking percent for NOTHING. That number should be 2 or 3 percent total for them and a flat 10% for any "models" involved to receive in perpetuity. Do you think you're actually going to get trading royalties for these? AHAHAHAHAHA. That's as funny as "we'll pay struggling artists around the world" AHAHAHA. "Royalties are shared to Creators at this rate if the asset is sold using Metaplex Auction program". Do you know what "auction program" is being used? Can you check? Would you even know fucking how?

I'll take a guess for you and assume that you have zero fucking clue and that you've done zero fucking due diligance to find out. Great job!

This account is the creator of the "gallery":

https://solscan.io/account/HfHanjtnhBzJQSrUHZaMFjYsGAJA3YZu9cghmz9vRUZK

Which, as I'm looking now, shows that this user has created at least 10-20 other accounts for who knows what reason. So the creator account for this collection has multiple accounts of which to purchase through/from should they choose. Great. I'm not going to dig into each of these addresses right now (I may when the shit hits the fan) but each one very well could be a duplicate account meant to surreptitiosly artificially increase the price of their collection. Which, you know, you're not supposed to fucking do.

This account, LBA16AxBre184BL4NgPtFECME1wneFBM1TqjaSvu7Sd, has authority to "update" the NFT's "Program". Did you know that your "NFT" isn't actually a "legitimate" NFT like on other chains? It's a facsimile arranged by a similar yet incredibly fucking dumbed down process created for dumbfucks who don't read good. Presumably this program could "unveil" your mysterious assholes, however, without any publicly viewable codified logic behind the process this is entirely AT THE WILL OF THE CREATORS. Aka, they HAVE to choose which NFT is which there is no randomized process. They can just "update" themselves the presumably "rarest" or priciest NFT and then sell it back to the community at basically no cost to them. They can also mint themselves (because they haven't removed that authority for whatever reason) any NFT they choose and immediately sell it. Anytime. How hard is it to do that after minting one of each? "To prevent any more minting, you'll need set the minting authority to None"- but nope. They haven't done that. Why?

Alright alright, so what if the entire project is most likely a complete fraud, right? Who cares, right?

Well this guy certainly cares- he's the "creator" / owner of this shitshow and decided he wanted to attach his smug face to all of your assholes.

https://www.instagram.com/tiagopaiva__/

So who the fuck is this guy? Nothing comes up on Google so honestly I don't really give a shit about him. He's an actor, probably only an adult actor. So a talking fuckstick with a funny idea. Real inspiring project, guy.

Their "Marketing Expert"

https://www.instagram.com/r0ude/

AKA some kid with zero relevance to anything and a high follower count (aka his marketing skills). Let's completely ignore the fact that some asshole with 6 posts would never have 100+k followers and just skip straight to laughing at his chad photos poses. Hahaha. Ahahahahaha. Oh man. Hahahahahahah.

What about their "Community Chief Operator", Pierre? No social media link, no identity. Ergo, Pierre is made up. Who cares if they made up a Community Chief Operator though right, they've got the PornHub girl on their side... right? ... Yeah way to go dipshit PornHub girl you really vetted this one.

Sooo that's their whole team. Not a single crypto expert / developer. No one who knows a single thing about what they are trying to sell to all of their fans. Okaaaay. Uhm. Is that a red flag too?

------------------------------------------

This page apparently gives minting info but not really? I clicked "Mint Now" and instead of I dunno taking me *straight to the fucking gallery* on OpenSea they take you here:

https://www.lagaleriedesnft.com/mintlba/

> "PUBLIC MINT 2. During the public mint, we will giveaway an exclusive jewelry gold piece valued at 12,000$.
Each NFT minted gets you one entry. Join discord to know more. Good luck!"

So a shitty gold necklace is going to entice everyone to pay for a chance to enter to win a shitty gold necklace. Great. How the fuck is the winner chosen? Why would I want to join discord to know rules of entry that should be stated everywhere in clear fucking text? What and why are you hiding the real information?

There's even a "Connect Wallet" button on the page which I do not trust for a fucking second. Why would I want to connect my wallet to your shitty fucking site? Do you have any idea how unfucking trustworthy this is right off the bat? No legitimate site would ever ask this of you to "enter a chance" to win a fucking necklace.

I have to create a clean wallet environment to test out their stupid fucking button now. Great.

As of 3am(?) 3/22 according to Twitter:

> "After a successful SOLD OUT during the Public Mint 1, today you have the LAST CHANCE to mint “Le Bel Anus”. If you hold 2 LBA you’ll get one Meta “Fokin” Blinders for FREE!"

So apparently they were allowing idiots to mint NFTs that aren't worth shit so that they can, what, get another shitty fucking useless NFT for free? And you actually think we believe your joke of a scam sold out to real people? Come the fuck on. Don't make me go through your transaction history because I'll fucking do it. Why the fuck do you need to award a $12,000 necklace if your first bullshit minting parade was SOLD OUT? Or was it just sold out to yourself and your multiple accounts, I wonder?

------------------------------------------

Here's an article on this subject that sheds more light on the amount of bullshit this guy was snorting:

https://www.mccourier.com/he-created-nft-using-porn-stars-asses-and-he-wants-to-sell-them-for-millions/

> "Porn stars who “lend” their anuses to any of the works are entitled to 40 percent of the proceeds from the sale, plus one percent from each subsequent sale. This type of contract, recorded on the blockchain, guarantees that these assets are automatically and seamlessly transferred directly to cryptocurrency wallets."

HAHAHAHAHA. 40 percent WOOOOWWOWOW. You're all getting 40% huh? You know 40% of nothing is still nothing, right?

> “They can vote for the ten favorites from a list of two thousand stars. The ones that get the most votes will be the rarest and most valuable,” he explains. Each NFT will go on sale on March 12 for a base value of around €700, a conversion of 6.9 Solanas, the cryptocurrency chosen for these transactions. “The value is variable because the cryptocurrency market varies. It can be cheaper or more expensive depending on market variation.”

It is currently March 21st. What is being described is "securities trading". You know, that thing that's fucking regulated by government for some weird responsible reason.

> "At the moment, Tiago Paiva is still trying to fill the 500 or so spots in the anus gallery, but he guarantees that he will have all the necessary porn stars before the sale date. Busier are the community members on Discord trying to earn points with which they can guarantee that when the day comes they can snag one of the much-anticipated anuses.""

He did not.

> "Busier are the community members on Discord trying to earn points with which they can guarantee that when the day comes they can snag one of the much-anticipated anuses. ... The more active they are, the more points they earn. And whoever has the most points is allowed to be on the whitelist. Since there are only two thousand NFTs, not everyone can afford to buy one. If it’s whitelisted, there’s a guarantee you can buy it,” he says.

So why the fuck isn't this explained on their website? Why would any of you even think that's doing you a fucking favor?

> "This is also the reason why Tiago Paiva decided to always show his face. “The biggest danger sign is that the projects are anonymous, there is nobody who cares,” he says. “That’s why I wanted to show myself. People know me and feel safer.”

He showed his face for publicity. Fucking duh. If he knew half as much as was necessary for even a portion of his own bullshit roadmap he would have shut the fuck up and created a product first before advertising the idea to thousands of people. There is literally nothing put in place to protect the interests of either A) participating models or B) investors. Yes, investors. You are promoting an investment, not a game, not a donation- an investment. The fact that this entire project is billed as a method for early investors to earn more than later investors makes this one of the laziest fucking hidden ponzi scams I've had the displeasure of writing about. It's right fucking there in print on their own page. Enjoy your name being brought up in lawsuits.

------------------------------------------

Okay okay so not all of you are fucking idiots. Some of you are real fucking special idiots. It's one thing to not know what you're doing, it's another completely to use your place in society to fuck over the less fortunate. Not only did you attach your name and reputation to this shitshow, but you couldn't look past the shitstain veneer to realize that it would cause harm to others. Which it will.

Sure, it's a fun idea. Why not sell NFTs of everyone's asshole as a collection of "fine art"? There's nothing wrong with that, right? Right. I have no problem with the hilarity of this gimmick. I take issue with how poorly orchestrated and damaging this project will be to both the crypto and porn communities. Only a fucking jackass would vocally or otherwise advertise for this fucking cash grab. How fucking empty-headed do you have to be to think that scamming your followers into purchasing pictures of assholes will provide some sort of "value" to the community? You know it fucking doesn't- you all fucking know better.

Here is what I am going to do to prove that this and all of you are all fucking retarded:
1) I am going to recreate this project on Ethereum using ACTUAL fucking smart contracts.
2) I am going to provide this service free of cost and at an operational loss because fuck you.
3) I will not participate in minting or trading OR attempt to profit directly or indirectly from the collection.

With these 3 basic fucking steps I will recreate this stupid ass fucking project in a fair way that provides ACTUAL fucking fair results for you dipshits. You're welcome.

Love, Alex D.
